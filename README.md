## How it Works

The Focus Mode Chrome Extension works by highlighting specific content on a web page and blocking out the rest. You can choose which elements to highlight, such as text, images, or videos, and adjust the level of focus to suit your needs.

Once you activate Focus Mode, the highlighted content will be the only thing visible on the page, allowing you to concentrate fully on what you're reading or watching. This can be especially helpful when you need to read a long article or study a complex diagram, as it reduces the temptation to get distracted by other elements on the page.
